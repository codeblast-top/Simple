# Simple

A simple example generated from Android Studio using an Empty Activity from the Phone and Tablet template.

## Notes

When running the ./gradlew command, you might see the following warning:

```
 The org.gradle.api.plugins.Convention type has been deprecated. ...
```

One of the Libraries in the generated build.gradle.kts file is using the plugin.  For now, it should be safe to ignore.
